# File-Organizer

I had a proplem where too many screenshots where populated my desktop screen. so I wrote this program for it. 

The Screenshot File Organizer is a Python script designed to help you organize screenshot files within a specified directory. It identifies files with the word "Screenshot" in their names and moves them into a subdirectory named "screenshots."
